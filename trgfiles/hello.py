# If a string has a ' in it it has to be bound by ""
# If a string has a " in it it has to be bound by ''
# If it has both, bind it by "" or ''and place \before the internal ' or "
# eg
# print ("Mary\'s dog said \"Woof\"")
"""Rather than use a bunch of # and single lines for comments you can
enclose a multi line comment with three double quotes"""
# print ("Success")
"""Numbers cannot contain spaces, dollar signs commas, multiple hyphens, words, parenthesis or more than
one decimal point.  The can contain a singly hyphen, one decimal point"""
# Integer is a whole number positive or negative
# A float is any number and can co# All operators require a space around them IAW the style guide so 1+1 is not good but 1 + 1 is good.
# Can contain scientific notation ie 6.02e23
"""Words are strings.  Strings can contain pretty much any charachter available on the keyboard so
long as you bind them IAW the rules in lines 1-6"""
# Booleans are true or false variables that usually result as std o/p although they can be 
# assigned ie x = true, y = false.  You do no bind them with quotes as they are variables.
""" Math operators are +, -, *, /, % (express the remainder after division also called modulus), 
** (exponent or 3**2=9), // (floor division which is the whole number resulting from division ie 26//9 = 2)"""
""" Comparison operators include <, > <=, >=, == (equal to), != (not equal to), is (object identity) and is not (negated object identity)"""
""" Boolean operators are or (one is true = x or y), and (both are true = x and y), not (x is not full = not x)"""
# All operators require a space around them IAW the style guide so 1+1 is not good but 1 + 1 is good.
# Variables must start with a letter (case sensitive but lower case is recommended in PEP8) or an underscore
# Variables cannot be bound by quotes but if the content of the variable is a string the string is bound ie user_name = "Alan Turing"
